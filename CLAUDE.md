# CLAUDE.md — agent/contributor guide for Conjuga (dli-skills-builder)

## What this is

A static, no-build, no-login web app for K-5 Spanish Dual Language Immersion
learners: conjugation practice for the 100 most common Spanish verbs, 5 at a
time, in present / preterite / imperfect. Deployed to GitHub Pages from `main`.

## Golden rules

1. **Linguistic accuracy is the product.** Any change to `js/conjugator.js` or
   `js/verbs.js` MUST be accompanied by tests in `tests/conjugator.test.mjs`
   with hand-verified forms (RAE conjugation tables are the reference). Run
   `npm test` before committing — all tests must pass.
2. **No build step, no dependencies, no login, no analytics.** The app is plain
   ES modules served statically. Do not add bundlers, frameworks, trackers, or
   anything requiring a server. Progress lives only in `localStorage`
   (versioned key `conjuga.v1` — bump the version if the schema changes
   incompatibly).
3. **Novice-first pedagogy.** Feedback is corrective, never punitive; recognition
   (Elige) precedes production (Escribe); present tense is presented before past
   tenses. Keep UI text bilingual: Spanish first, short English support.
   Design decisions should be defensible against docs/STANDARDS.md.
4. **K-5 audience.** Big touch targets (≥44px), simple sentences, emoji-friendly,
   dark mode and reduced-motion respected, ARIA live regions for feedback.

## Commands

```bash
npm test     # node --test tests/*.test.mjs — accuracy/invariant/feature/budget tests
npm run e2e  # headless-Chromium end-to-end suite (tests/e2e/smoke.mjs)
npm start    # python3 -m http.server 8080 (any static server works)
```

For `npm run e2e`, install Playwright first (`npm i --no-save playwright`
plus `npx playwright install chromium`, or in the remote environment set
CHROMIUM_PATH=/opt/pw-browsers/chromium-*/chrome-linux/chrome). Any new UI
surface MUST be covered by the e2e suite — it is the gate that lets loop
iterations auto-merge into dev. Playwright is CI/dev tooling only; it must
never become an app dependency.

## Architecture

- `js/conjugator.js` — pure engine. Regular paradigms computed from the
  infinitive; irregularities driven by per-verb flags (`pres`, `presYo`,
  `presStem`, `pret`, `pretStem`, `pret3`, `imp`). Orthographic changes
  (-car/-gar/-zar yo-preterite, vowel-stem y-insertion, -guir/-gir/-cer yo
  spellings) are automatic — don't add flags for them.
- `js/verbs.js` — dataset. 100 verbs, frequency-ranked, `SETS` = 20 groups of 5.
  Note: *gustar* is intentionally replaced by *comer* (novices learn gustar as
  a chunk, not a conjugated paradigm).
- `js/game.js` — question sampling (every verb in a set appears ≥1× per round),
  multiple-choice distractors (naive regularization > same-person-other-tense >
  same-tense-other-person), match pairs (unique forms only), and the
  preterite/imperfect contrast generator (`TENSE_CUES` are the conventional
  classroom time-cue triggers — a deliberate novice simplification).
- `js/storage.js` — localStorage wrapper; stars = 3 (100%), 2 (≥80%), 1 (≥60%);
  each result stores an `at` timestamp driving the spaced-repetition queue
  (due after 0/1/3/7 days for 0/1/2/3 stars; entries without `at` never due).
- `js/audio.js` — Web Speech TTS. Prefers a local es-MX/es-US voice; every
  audio control hides when `ttsAvailable()` is false. `sound` setting mutes.
- `js/mascot.js` — Lola la Lechuza (inline SVG; states are single CSS
  classes; decorative/aria-hidden; silent — TTS is for Spanish forms only;
  binding design spec in docs/MASCOT.md; keep within the 15 KB budget and
  the payload test in tests/payload.test.mjs).
- `js/app.js` — hash-routed screens (`#/set/3`, `#/study/3/present`,
  `#/play/3/present/choice`, `#/play/3/contrast`, `#/informe`). DOM built with
  a small `el()` helper; no innerHTML for user-derived strings. The contrast
  challenge records under key `<setId>.past.contrast` (STARS_PER_SET = 30).
  🎧 Escucha records under `<setId>.<tense>.listen` — badges on a parallel
  track, deliberately excluded from MODES and every star denominator;
  the mode renders only when `ttsAvailable()`.
  Print styles live in styles.css (`@media print` + `.no-print`).
- Persons are always indexed 0-5 (yo, tú, él/ella/Ud., nosotros, vosotros,
  ellos/Uds.); vosotros (index 4) is filtered at the UI layer per user setting,
  never removed from data.

## Git workflow & deployment

- **Never commit or push directly to `main`.** All work happens on dev
  branches (`dev/<topic>`, `feature/<topic>`, or an agent session branch);
  commit there and push with `git push -u origin <branch>`.
- **Merging to `main` is the deploy.** `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` runs
  the test suite and publishes the repo root to GitHub Pages only on push to
  `main` (a PR merge) or a manual `workflow_dispatch`. Pushes to dev branches
  never deploy.
- Open a pull request from the dev branch into `main` when the work is
  validated (tests passing, UI exercised in a browser). The deploy is
  test-gated, but run `npm test` before pushing anyway — a red test suite
  blocks the Pages publish, leaving production on the previous version.
- Keep changes deployable: `main` should always represent the live site.
- All asset URLs must remain relative (the app is served from
  /dli-skills-builder/, not the domain root).

## Semi-autonomous loops

Agent sessions doing unattended iterations MUST follow `docs/LOOP.md`.
Branch model: `loop/<date>-<slug>` (one per iteration, from `origin/dev`)
→ PR into `dev` with **native auto-merge** enabled, gated by the required
CI checks (`unit` + `e2e`) → a rolling `Release: dev → main` PR that only
a human merges (that merge is the production deploy). Work derives only
from `GOAL.md`'s current milestone; context comes from the newest
`journal/*.md` files; each iteration writes its own `journal/` entry.
Loops never push `dev`/`main` directly, never merge manually, never touch
workflows or settings, and never weaken tests to get green.

## Documentation map

- `GOAL.md` — north star, product invariants, milestone queue (the loop's
  only source of work; humans edit it to redirect)
- `JOURNAL.md` — append-only iteration log (read the tail before working)
- `docs/LOOP.md` — the loop protocol and its hard guardrails
- `README.md` — user/teacher-facing overview
- `docs/SPEC.md` — product + technical specification and design decisions
- `docs/STANDARDS.md` — NBPTS ECYA-WL and NJSLS-WL alignment (cite it when
  making pedagogy-affecting changes)
- `about.html` — learner/parent-facing standards & privacy page (keep in sync
  with docs/STANDARDS.md)
